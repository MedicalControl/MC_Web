# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Project Overview
This project is built using React, a powerful and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React was chosen for its component-based architecture, which allows for easy reuse of UI elements and efficient state management across the application.

# Why React?
React enables a dynamic, interactive experience by breaking down the user interface into smaller, manageable components. Each component is self-contained and can be easily modified or reused across different parts of the application, promoting scalability and maintainability. By using React, we ensure the app is both performant and adaptable to future changes.

# Component Structure
Each component in this project is organized in individual `.js` files, promoting modularity and cleaner code. This structure allows for better readability and separation of concerns, as each component focuses on a single responsibility within the application.

# Styling: From CSS to Tailwind CSS
Currently, we are using traditional CSS to style the application. However, we plan to transition to Tailwind CSS for several reasons:

* **Utility-first approach:** Tailwind CSS offers a utility-first approach to styling, meaning that instead of writing custom stylesheets, we can use predefined classes directly in our markup. This significantly speeds up development time.
* **Consistency**: Tailwind enforces a consistent design language throughout the project by providing a standard set of utilities and spacing rules.
* **Customization**: Despite its utility-first nature, Tailwind is highly customizable, allowing us to easily extend or override styles as needed.
* **Efficency**: By eliminating the need for custom CSS files, Tailwind helps keep the bundle size small, improving performance and loading times for end users.

By integrating Tailwind CSS in the near future, we aim to enhance the scalability, efficiency, and design consistency of our application.
